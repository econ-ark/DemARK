# Disable Environment Caching + Comprehensive Analysis Toolkit

## Problem Solved: False CI Successes Due to Environment Caching

This PR addresses a critical issue where GitHub Actions environment caching masked breaking changes in HARK, causing **4+ months of false CI successes** while fresh environment reproductions were failing.

### üîç Root Cause Analysis (Fully Documented)

**Timeline of the Problem:**
- **November 29, 2023**: Environment cache created (commit `6d0aa34`) - notebooks had old imports, HARK had old structure
- **May 22, 2024**: HARK introduced breaking changes (commit `7a6e8f39`) - moved `HARK.datasets` ‚Üí `HARK.Calibration`
- **September 2024**: DemARK commit `ffc6131` appeared "successful" but only due to cached environment
- **October 2, 2024**: Last false "successful" CI run using 307-day-old cached environment
- **Impact**: CI used cached environment from before breaking changes while fresh environments failed

**Specific Breaking Changes:**
- `from HARK.datasets import load_SCF_wealth_weights` ‚Üí `from HARK.Calibration import load_SCF_wealth_weights`
- Affected notebooks: `LC-Model-Expected-Vs-Realized-Income-Growth.ipynb`, `Micro-and-Macro-Implications-of-Very-Impatient-HHs.ipynb`

## üõ†Ô∏è Changes Made

### 1. Environment Caching Disabled
- **File**: `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- **Change**: Commented out `cache-environment: true`
- **Result**: CI now tests against actual current HARK master (not cached versions)

### 2. Notebooks Reverted to Historical State
- **Files**: `LC-Model-Expected-Vs-Realized-Income-Growth.ipynb`, `Micro-and-Macro-Implications-of-Very-Impatient-HHs.ipynb`
- **Change**: Reverted to commit `6d0aa34` state with original old imports
- **Result**: Reproduction script now tests historically accurate combination

### 3. Comprehensive Analysis Toolkit Created
- **Location**: `caching_problems_fix/` directory
- **Purpose**: Detect, analyze, and diagnose similar caching issues in the future

## üìö Complete Documentation & Tools

This PR includes a **comprehensive analysis toolkit** with full documentation:

### üîß Analysis Scripts
1. **`find_cache_interval.sh`** - Manual cache interval analysis
2. **`find_cache_interval_auto.sh`** - Automated breaking change detection
3. **`detect_import_breaks.sh`** - Deep Python import analysis
4. **`detect_import_breaks_simple.sh`** - Quick HARK-specific detection
5. **`last-working-ci-before-0p16.sh`** - Reproduce working CI environment
6. **`demo.sh`** - Complete workflow demonstration

### üìñ Full Documentation
**See `caching_problems_fix/README.md`** for:
- Complete technical analysis of the caching problem
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- Detailed explanation of each analysis script
- Alternative caching solutions for future consideration
- Root cause analysis with exact timeline

### üß™ Verification
The toolkit has been **fully tested** and successfully:
- ‚úÖ Reproduced the genuinely working state from November 29, 2023 (commit `6d0aa34`)
- ‚úÖ Uses historically accurate combination: notebooks with old imports + HARK with old structure
- ‚úÖ Identified all breaking changes and their timeline
- ‚úÖ Verified that disabling caching fixes the issue
- ‚úÖ Created reusable tools for detecting similar problems

## üéØ Impact

### Immediate Fixes
- **CI now accurately reflects current HARK compatibility**
- **False successes eliminated** - CI will fail when HARK master breaks DemARK
- **Reproducible environments** - fresh setups now match CI results

### Future Prevention
- **Reusable analysis toolkit** for similar caching issues
- **Comprehensive documentation** of the problem and solution
- **Alternative caching strategies** documented for future implementation

## üîÑ Alternative Solutions (Future Consideration)

The PR documents several alternatives if environment caching is desired:

1. **Commit-based caching**: Resolve git commits before creating cache keys
2. **Explicit commit pins**: Pin to specific commits with automated updates
3. **Daily cache invalidation**: Use date-based cache keys

**Current approach prioritizes correctness over speed** - CI will be slower but will actually test what it claims to test.

## üìÅ Files Changed

- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Disabled environment caching
- `binder/environment.yml` - Restored `@master` (from pinned commit)
- `notebooks/LC-Model-Expected-Vs-Realized-Income-Growth.ipynb` - Reverted to historical state with old imports
- `notebooks/Micro-and-Macro-Implications-of-Very-Impatient-HHs.ipynb` - Reverted to historical state with old imports
- `caching_problems_fix/` - **Complete analysis toolkit** (8 scripts + documentation)
- `.gitignore` - Added patterns for temporary files

## üß¨ Technical Details

**Cache Key Issue**: `setup-micromamba` generates cache keys from environment file hash, not the actual commit that `git+https://github.com/econ-ark/hark@master` resolves to. This caused 11-month-old cached environments to be reused even as HARK master evolved.

**Verification Method**: The included `last-working-ci-before-0p16.sh` script reproduces the genuinely working state from November 29, 2023 (commit `6d0aa34`) when the cache was created. This ensures historical accuracy by using notebooks with old imports (`HARK.datasets`) combined with HARK before breaking changes - the exact combination that truly worked together.
