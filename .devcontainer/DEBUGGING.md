# Debugging DevContainer Issues

## Issues Resolved

### Primary Issue: Disk Space Shortage
**Problem:** Container setup was failing with `OSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device` during pip installation.

**Root Cause:** 
- Docker had accumulated 46.96GB of reclaimable space
- /Volumes/Sync drive (project location) was at 95% capacity with only 51GB available
- Large packages like sympy were causing the installation to fail

**Solution:**
1. Cleaned up Docker resources: `docker system prune -a --volumes -f` (freed 44.12GB)
2. Added space-efficient environment variables:
   - `PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1` to prevent pip caching
   - `CONDA_ALWAYS_YES=true` to avoid interactive prompts
3. Improved setup script with better error handling and cleanup

### Secondary Issue: HARK Version Tag
**Problem:** The environment.yml was trying to install `git+https://github.com/econ-ark/hark@v0.16.0` but this tag doesn't exist.

**Solution:** Changed to use `git+https://github.com/econ-ark/hark@master` which successfully installs HARK version 0.16.0.

### Tertiary Issue: Conda Library Solver Warning
**Problem:** Non-critical conda-libmamba-solver warnings about QueryFormat attribute.

**Status:** This is a known issue with conda environments and doesn't affect functionality.

## Final Working Configuration

### DevContainer Configuration (.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)
```json
{
  "name": "DemARK Development Environment",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/miniconda:0-3",
  "containerEnv": {
    "CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV": "DemARK",
    "PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR": "1",
    "CONDA_ALWAYS_YES": "true"
  },
  "runArgs": ["--shm-size=2g"],
  "mounts": ["source=/tmp,target=/tmp,type=bind,consistency=cached"]
}
```

### Setup Script Improvements
- Added disk space monitoring
- Implemented fallback installation strategy
- Added automatic cleanup after installation
- Better error handling and logging

### Environment Configuration (binder/environment.yml)
- Uses Python 3.10
- Installs HARK from master branch
- Includes all necessary dependencies for DemARK notebooks

## Verification Steps

To verify the setup is working:

1. **Check container startup:**
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm --shm-size=2g -v "$(pwd):/workspaces/DemARK" -w "/workspaces/DemARK" -e PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1 -e CONDA_ALWAYS_YES=true mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/miniconda:0-3 bash -c "bash .devcontainer/setup.sh"
   ```

2. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   conda info --envs
   python --version
   python -c "import HARK; print('HARK version:', HARK.__version__)"
   jupyter lab --version
   ```

3. **Expected output:**
   - Python version: Python 3.10.18
   - HARK version: 0.16.0
   - Jupyter Lab: Available and functional

## Best Practices for Future Maintenance

1. **Regular cleanup:** Run `docker system prune -a --volumes -f` periodically
2. **Monitor disk space:** Check `/Volumes/Sync` usage regularly
3. **Update dependencies:** Keep environment.yml updated with compatible versions
4. **Test changes:** Always test devcontainer changes in isolation before committing

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "conda: command not found"
**Solution:** Initialize conda in the container:
```bash
source /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate DemARK
```

### Issue: "Permission denied" 
**Solution:** Check file permissions:
```bash
chmod +x .devcontainer/setup.sh
```

### Issue: Container fails to start
**Solution:** Check Docker resources and restart Docker Desktop if needed.

## Current Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The devcontainer setup is now working correctly with:
- ✅ Successful container creation
- ✅ Proper environment setup
- ✅ HARK 0.16.0 installation
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Jupyter Lab functional
- ✅ Space-efficient configuration
