- **`test_jupyter.ipynb`** - Test notebook with math and HARK
- **`notebooks/`** - All DemARK example notebooks
- **Full scientific environment** - Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, HARK

## **Troubleshooting**

**If you get "command not found" for socat:**
```bash
brew install socat
```

**If the port is in use:**
