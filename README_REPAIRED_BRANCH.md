# Repaired Scripts After Breaking Change

This branch demonstrates the complete solution to the HARK breaking change issue that was masked by CI environment caching.

## Background

- **May 22, 2024**: HARK commit `7a6e8f39` moved `HARK.datasets` to `HARK.Calibration`
- **September 18, 2024**: DemARK commit `ffc6131` appeared successful in CI but had old imports
- **Problem**: Environment caching masked the breaking change for 4 months

## What This Branch Contains

### Fixed Notebooks
- `notebooks/LC-Model-Expected-Vs-Realized-Income-Growth.ipynb` - Updated with correct imports
- All other notebooks work without changes

### Environment Setup
- `binder/environment.yml` - Configured with HARK commit `7a6e8f39` (the breaking change)

### Demonstration Scripts
- `test_problematic_notebooks.sh` - Tests the two affected notebooks
- `fix_problematic_notebooks.sh` - Applies and verifies the fixes

## Usage

1. **Setup environment** (first time only):
   ```bash
   mamba env create -f binder/environment.yml
   ```

2. **Test the original problem**:
   ```bash
   # First revert to old imports to see the problem
   git show HEAD~1:notebooks/LC-Model-Expected-Vs-Realized-Income-Growth.ipynb > notebooks/LC-Model-Expected-Vs-Realized-Income-Growth.ipynb
   ./test_problematic_notebooks.sh
   ```

3. **Apply and verify the fix**:
   ```bash
   ./fix_problematic_notebooks.sh
   ```

## The Fix

The breaking change moved HARK modules:
```python
# BEFORE (broken):
from HARK.datasets.life_tables.us_ssa.SSATools import parse_ssa_life_table

# AFTER (fixed):
from HARK.Calibration.life_tables.us_ssa.SSATools import parse_ssa_life_table
```

## Environment Details

- **HARK Version**: 0.14.1 (commit `7a6e8f39` - the breaking change)
- **Python**: 3.10
- **Environment Name**: `DemARK_problematic_combo`

This environment demonstrates what CI should have been testing if not for caching.

## Complete Demonstration

This branch provides a complete, reproducible demonstration of:
- The CI caching problem that masked breaking changes
- The exact fix needed (HARK.datasets â†’ HARK.Calibration)
- Verification that the fix works

The environment is configured to use the exact HARK version where the breaking change occurred, so you can see both the problem and the solution in action.
