# HARK Caching Investigation Toolkit - Diagnostic Tools for CI Issue Discovery

## üîç Purpose

This PR provides the **diagnostic tools and comprehensive documentation** that discovered and analyzed the 11-month CI caching issue affecting DemARK notebook compatibility with HARK v0.16+.

## üéØ Problem Context

**The Mystery**: DemARK CI was passing for 11 months while notebooks were broken for fresh installations.

**The Discovery**: Through systematic investigation using the tools in this PR, we discovered that GitHub Actions had cached a conda environment from November 2023 containing HARK v0.13.0, masking compatibility breaks introduced in HARK v0.16.0 (March 2024).

## üõ†Ô∏è Investigation Tools Provided

### **Core Diagnostic Scripts**
Located in `caching_problems_fix/` directory:

#### 1. **`bisect_hark_breaking_changes.sh`** üî¨
- **Purpose**: Git bisect automation to find exact HARK version that broke compatibility
- **What it does**: Systematically tests HARK versions to isolate breaking changes
- **Usage**: `./bisect_hark_breaking_changes.sh`
- **Key insight**: Identified HARK v0.16.0 as the breaking point

#### 2. **`last-working-ci-before-0p16-preserve.sh`** üì∏
- **Purpose**: Preserve and replicate the last known working CI state
- **What it does**: Creates snapshot of working environment before HARK v0.16 changes
- **Usage**: `./last-working-ci-before-0p16-preserve.sh`
- **Key insight**: Documented exact working configuration for comparison

#### 3. **`reproduce-problematic-combo.sh`** üîÑ
- **Purpose**: Reproduce the exact problematic environment combination
- **What it does**: Creates environments that demonstrate the caching issue
- **Usage**: `./reproduce-problematic-combo.sh`
- **Key insight**: Proved caching was masking real compatibility issues

### **Testing & Validation Scripts**

#### 4. **`test_ci_locally.sh`** ‚ö°
- **Purpose**: Run exact CI commands locally with fresh environments
- **What it does**: Replicates GitHub Actions workflow locally for debugging
- **Usage**: `./test_ci_locally.sh`
- **Key insight**: Revealed that fresh environments fail while cached ones pass

#### 5. **`setup_conda.sh`** üêç
- **Purpose**: Standardized conda environment setup for consistent testing
- **What it does**: Creates reproducible conda environments for investigation
- **Usage**: `./setup_conda.sh [environment_name]`
- **Key insight**: Enabled controlled testing across different HARK versions

#### 6. **`test_complete_setup.sh`** üß™
- **Purpose**: End-to-end testing of complete DemARK setup
- **What it does**: Full validation from environment creation to notebook execution
- **Usage**: `./test_complete_setup.sh`
- **Key insight**: Comprehensive validation of fixes

### **Comprehensive Documentation**

#### 7. **`README.md`** üìö
- **Purpose**: Complete explanation of investigation methodology and tools
- **What it contains**:
  - Problem summary and root cause analysis
  - Detailed script documentation
  - Investigation workflow and relationships
  - Historical timeline of the issue
  - Usage examples and best practices

## üîó Cross-References

**This investigation led to**:
- **Core Fixes**: [PR #220](https://github.com/econ-ark/DemARK/pull/220) - The actual compatibility fixes
- **Development Environment**: [DevContainer PR] - Reproducible development setup used during investigation

**Investigation Timeline**:
1. **Discovery**: CI passing but fresh installs failing
2. **Hypothesis**: Caching issue suspected
3. **Tool Development**: Created diagnostic scripts in this PR
4. **Root Cause Found**: 11-month-old cached environment identified
5. **Solution Implemented**: Fixed in PR #220

## üéØ Value Proposition

### **Immediate Value**
- Provides complete toolkit for investigating CI caching issues
- Documents the methodology that solved an 11-month mystery
- Enables local reproduction of CI environments for debugging

### **Long-term Value**
- **Reusable tools** for future HARK compatibility investigations
- **Best practices** for diagnosing CI caching problems
- **Historical record** of how the issue was discovered and resolved
- **Educational resource** for understanding CI/conda environment interactions

## üèÜ Investigation Success

Using these tools, we successfully:
- ‚úÖ Identified the exact root cause (cached environment from Nov 2023)
- ‚úÖ Pinpointed the breaking HARK version (v0.16.0)
- ‚úÖ Developed targeted fixes (implemented in PR #220)
- ‚úÖ Validated solutions with comprehensive testing
- ‚úÖ Prevented future occurrences of the same issue
