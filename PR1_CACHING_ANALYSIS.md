# Fix CI Environment Caching Issue That Masked HARK Breaking Changes

## Problem Summary

DemARK's GitHub Actions CI was reporting successful runs while fresh environment reproductions were failing. Investigation revealed that environment caching masked breaking changes for **11 months**, preventing detection of HARK compatibility issues.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Timeline of Events
- **November 29, 2023**: Last change to `binder/environment.yml` (created cached environment)
- **May 22, 2024**: HARK introduced breaking changes (commit `7a6e8f39`) moving `HARK.datasets` to `HARK.Calibration`
- **September 18, 2024**: DemARK commit `ffc6131` appeared "successful" in CI (false positive)
- **October 2, 2024**: Last actual successful CI run

### Cache Key Logic Issue
The `setup-micromamba` action generates cache keys using:
- Hash of environment file contents
- Hash of extra specs  
- Environment name and OS
- **NOT** the actual commit that `git+https://github.com/econ-ark/hark@master` resolves to

This meant the cache key remained identical even as HARK master changed, causing the 307-day-old cached environment to be reused indefinitely.

### Breaking Change Details
- **Old import**: `from HARK.datasets import load_SCF_wealth_weights`
- **New import**: `from HARK.Calibration import load_SCF_wealth_weights`
- **Affected notebooks**: `Micro-and-Macro-Implications-of-Very-Impatient-HHs.ipynb`

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Disable Environment Caching
Remove `cache-environment: true` from `.github/workflows/` to ensure CI tests against current HARK versions.

### 2. Diagnostic Tools Created
- **`bisect_hark_breaking_changes.sh`**: Automated git bisection to find HARK commits that break DemARK notebooks
- **Analysis scripts**: Comprehensive toolset for detecting and analyzing CI caching issues

### 3. Verification
- Confirmed no additional breaking changes between resolved issue and HARK v0.16.1
- Validated that fixing import paths resolves all compatibility issues

## Files Changed

### New Diagnostic Tools
- `bisect_hark_breaking_changes.sh` - Automated HARK breaking change detection
- Analysis and documentation of the caching timeline

### CI Configuration  
- Remove environment caching to prevent future masking of breaking changes

## Impact

✅ **Immediate**: CI now accurately reflects HARK compatibility  
✅ **Future**: Breaking changes will be detected within days, not months  
✅ **Diagnostic**: Reusable tools for analyzing similar caching issues  

## Testing

- Verified bisection script correctly identifies the `7a6e8f39` breaking commit
- Confirmed current DemARK notebooks work with HARK v0.16.1 after import fixes
- Validated that no additional breaking changes exist in recent HARK versions

## References

- **Breaking commit**: [`7a6e8f39`](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/commit/7a6e8f39) - Move datasets to Calibration
- **Cache analysis**: 307 days of false CI successes due to stale environment
- **Solution verification**: Bisection confirms no new breaking changes post-fix

This PR provides the diagnostic foundation. A separate PR will implement the actual notebook fixes to restore HARK v0.16+ compatibility.
