But it is not obvious how to treat consumers whose debt, say, was 0.3 before the constraint was tightened.  A simple, but implausible, approach is to assume that such consumer must immediately cut their consumption by enough to reduce their debt to the new more stringent maximum.  A reasonable solution might be to say that the new tighter constraint applies only to new borrowers; different papers in the literature take different approaches to this transition question."
