    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmark Krusell-Smith model has the following broad features:\n",
    "   * The aggregate state switches between good and bad with known probabilities\n",
    "   * All consumers experience the same aggregate state for the economy (good or bad)\n",
    "   * _ex ante_ there is only one type of consumer, which is infinitely lived\n",
    "   * _ex post_ heterogeneity arises from uninsurable idiosyncratic income shocks\n",
    "      * Specifically, individuals are at risk of spells of unemployment\n",
    "      * In a spell of unemployment, their income is zero\n",
    "   \n",
    "Thus, each agent faces two types of uncertainty: About their employment state, and about the income they will earn when employed.  And the values of income and unemployment risk depend on the aggregate state.\n"

    "### Details\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Idiosyncratic\n",
    "Each agent _attempts_ to supply an amount of productive labor $\\ell$ in each period.  (Here and below we mostly follow the notation of Krusell and Smith (1998)).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, whether they _succeed_ in supplying that labor (and earning a corresponding wage) is governed by the realization of the stochastic variable $\\epsilon$.  If the agent is unlucky, $\\epsilon$ is zero and the agent is unemployed.  The amount of labor they succeed in supplying is thus $\\epsilon\\ell$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aggregate\n",
    "Aggregate output ($\\bar{y}$) is produced using a Cobb-Douglas production function using capital and labor. (Bars over variables indicate the aggregate value of a variable that has different values across different idiosyncratic consumers).\n",
    "\n",
    "$z$ denotes the aggregate shock to productivity. $z$ can take two values, either $z_g$ -- the \"good\" state, or $z_b < z_g$ -- the \"bad\" state.  Consumers gain income from providing labor, and from the rental return on any capital they own.  Labor and capital markets are perfectly efficient so both factors are both paid their marginal products.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent can choose to save by buying capital $k$ which is bounded below at the borrowing constraint of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting all of this together, aggregate output is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "\\bar{y} & = & z\\bar{k}^\\alpha \\bar{\\ell}^{1-\\alpha}\n",

    "The aggregate shocks $z$ follow a first-order Markov chains with the transition probability of moving from state $s$ to state $s'$ denoted by $\\pi_{ss'}$. The aggregate shocks and individual shocks are correlated: The probability of being unemployed is higher in bad times, when aggregate productivity is low, than in good times, when aggregate productivity is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Idiosyncratic and Aggregate Together\n",
    "\n",
    "The individual shocks satisfy the law of large numbers, and the model is constructed so that the number of agents who are unemployed in the good state always equals $u_g$, and is always $u_b$ in the bad state. Given the aggregate state, individual shocks are independent from each other.\n",

    "##### Discussion of the KS Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, $\\Gamma$ is a high-dimensional object because it includes the whole distribution of individuals' wealth in the economy. Because the optimal amount to save is a nonlinear function of the level of idiosyncratic $k$, next period's aggregate capital stock $\\bar{k}'$ depends on the distribution of the holdings of idiosyncratic $k$ across the population of consumers. Therefore the law of motion $H$ is not a trivial function of the $\\Gamma$. \n",
    "\n",
    "KS simplified this problem as by noting the following. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The agent cares about the future aggregate aggregate state only insofar as that state affects their own personal value of $c$\n",
    "1. Future values of $c$ depend on the aggregate state only through the budget constraint\n",
    "1. The channels by which the budget constraint depends on the aggregate state are:\n",
    "   * The probability distributions of $\\epsilon$ and $z$ are affected by the aggregate state\n",
    "   * Interest rates and wages depend on the future values of $\\bar{k}$ and $\\bar{\\ell}$\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now note that\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The probability distributions for the future values of $\\{\\epsilon, z\\}$ are known; they are fully determined by the Markov transition matrices\n",
    "1. The values of $r$ and $w$ are both determined by the future value of $\\bar{k}$ (in combination with the exogenous value of $\\bar{\\ell}$)\n",
    "1. So the only endogenous object that the agent needs to form expectations about, in order to have a complete rational expectation about everything affecting them, is $\\bar{k}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The key result in Krusell and Smith is the discovery that a very simple linear rule does an extraordinarily good job (though not quite perfect) in forecasting $\\bar{k}$\n",
    "\n",
    "They then argue that, since rationality is surely bounded to some degree, the solution that an agent obtains using a good forecasting rule for $\\bar{k}$ is \"good enough\" to compute an \"approximate\" solution to the consumer's optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "They define a generic algorithm to find a forecasting rule for $\\bar{k}$ as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose the number of moments $n$ of the distribution of $k$ to be included in the set of variables to forecast $\\bar{k}'$. In the simplest case, $n=1$, the only forecasting variable for next period's $\\bar{k}'$ is the mean (the first moment, $n=1$)) of current capital, $\\bar{k}$.\n",
    "2. Each individual adopts the same belief about the law motion of these moments, $H_I$ and finds the optimal decision policy, $f_I$, contingent on that guess.\n",
    "3. Use the optimal policy to simulate a history of aggregate capital with a large number of agents. \n",
    "4. Characterize the realized law of motion using the same number of moments $n$ \n",
    "5. Compare it with the $H_I$, what is taken as given by individuals. \n",
    "6. Iterate until the two converge. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the solution to the original problem is well approximated by the following simplified problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "V(k, \\epsilon; \\bar k, z) &=& max_{c, k'}\\{U(c) + \\beta E[V(k' ,\\epsilon'; \\bar k', z')|z, \\epsilon]\\} \\\\\n",
    "c + k' &=& r(\\bar{k}, \\bar{\\ell}, z)k + w(\\bar{k}, \\bar{\\ell}, z)l\\epsilon + (1-\\delta)k; \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "As the figures show, the distribution of wealth that the baseline KS model produces is very far from matching the empirical degree of inequality in the US data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could matter for macroeconomic purposes.  For example, the SCF data indicate that many agents are concentrated at low values of wealth where the MPC is very large.  We might expect, therefore, that a fiscal policy \"stimulus\" that gives a fixed amount of money to every agent would have a large effect on the consumption of the low-wealth households who have a high Marginal Propensity to Consume.\n",
    "\n",
    "KS attempt to address this problem by assuming that an individual agent's time preference rate can change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale is that this represents a generational transition: The \"agent\" is really a \"dynasty\" and the time preference rate of the \"child\" dynast may differ from that of the \"parent.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, KS assume that $\\beta$ can take on three values, 0.9858, 0.9894, and 0.9930, and that the transition probabilities are such that \n",
    "- The invariant distribution for $\\beta$’s has 80 percent of the population at the middle $\\beta$ and 10 percent at each of the other $\\beta$’s.\n",
    "- Immediate transitions between the extreme values of $\\beta$ occur with probability zero. \n",
    "- The average duration of the highest and lowest $\\beta$’s is 50 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "The HARK toolkit is not natively set up to accommodate stochastic time preference factors (though an extension to accommodate this would be easy).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, instead, we assume that different agents have different values of $\\beta$ that are uniformly distributed over some range. We approximate the uniform distribution by seven points.  The agents are heterogeneous _ex ante_ (and permanently)."
