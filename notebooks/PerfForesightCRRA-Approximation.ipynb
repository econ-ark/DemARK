    "[PerfectForesightCRRA](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/public/lecturenotes/Consumption/PerfForesightCRRA) derives a number of results as approximations; for instance, the exact formula for the consumption function is derived as $$c_t = \\left(\\frac{R - (R\\beta)^{1/\\rho}}{R}\\right)o_t$$\n",

    "Your task is to make a series of plots that show how the quality of the approximation deteriorates as you change various model parameters. The notebook aims to make this easier by showing that under the baseline parameter values, the percentage amount of the error is pretty much constant across different values of market resources, so you can assume that is generically true.\n",
