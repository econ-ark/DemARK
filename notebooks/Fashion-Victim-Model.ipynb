Given this information, a $\\texttt{FashionVictimType}$'s infinite horizon microeconomic model can be solved by backward induction in a few lines; the \"one period solver\" is given by $\\texttt{solveFashion}$.  However, while individual agents treat the dynamics of $p_t$ as exogenous, they are in fact endogenously determined by the actions of all the fashion victims in the market.  A dynamic general equilibrium of the \"macroeconomic fashion model\" is thus characterized by a triple of $(a,b,w)$ such that when fashion victims believe in this \"punk evolution rule\" and act optimally, their collective fashion choices exhibit this same rule when the model is simulated.\n",
