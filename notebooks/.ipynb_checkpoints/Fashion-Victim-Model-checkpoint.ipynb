Given this information, a $\\texttt{FashionVictimType}$'s infinite horizon microeconomic model can be solved by backward induction in a few lines; the \"one period solver\" is given by $\\texttt{solveFashion}$.  However, while individual agents treat the dynamics of $p_t$ as exogenous, they are in fact endogenously determined by the actions of all the fashion victims in the market.
