    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Buffer stock saving models of the kind implemented in $\\texttt{ConsIndShockType}$ say that the _ratio_ of asets **a** to permanent income **p**, $a$=**a**/**p**, has a target value $\\check{a}$ that depends on the consumer's preferences (relative risk aversion, time preference) and circumstances (interest factor, growth factor, uncertainty).\n",
    "\n",
    "If everyone had identical preferences and everyone were at their target $\\check{a}$, then inequality in the level of **a** would be exactly the same as inequality in **p**.\n",
    "\n",
    "[\"The Distribution of Wealth and the Marginal Propensity to Consume\"](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/cstwMPC) (Carroll, Slacalek, Tokuoka, and White 2017; hereafter: \"cstwMPC\") shows that, when a consumption-saving model is simulated and agents draw their idiosyncratic shocks (so, agents are _ex post_ heterogeneous -- see the definition in [Intro-To-HARK](http://github.com/econ-ark/PARK/Intro-To-HARK-PrintMe.pdf), the theoretical point is roughly true: asset inequality is close to **p** inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a large body of evidence shows that _actual_ inequality in assets is much greater than _actual_ inequality in permanent income.  Thus, to have what the paper calls a 'serious' model (one that matches the facts the theory says _should_ matter for consumption behavior), the model can be modified to incorporate some form of _ex ante_ heterogeneity (again cf [Intro-To-HARK](http://github.com/econ-ark/PARK/Intro-To-HARK-PrintMe.pdf)): say, changing $\\beta$ or $R$ or $\\rho$ or $\\Gamma$ or $\\sigma^{2}_{\\psi}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most transparent and simplest of these to change is the time preference factor $\\beta$.  So that is what the paper does.  The key results of the paper are twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The distribution of $\\beta$ need not be particularly wide to match the extreme concentration of wealth: roughly 0.92 to 0.98 (annual); that is, the most impatient person discounts the future about 6 percentage points more per year than the most patient agent agent\n",
    "2. With such a distribution of $\\beta$, simulated agents' (annual) marginal propensity to consume (MPC) from transitory income shocks to income matches large body of microeconomic evidence that typically finds evidence of MPC's in the range of 0.2 to 0.6.  This is much better than RA macro models that typically yield MPC's in the range of 0.01 to 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some agents in the cstwMPC model have fairly high MPCs (~0.6 annual), there is microeconomic evidence that a significant fraction of households have *even higher* MPCs than the model predicts, especially at the quarterly frequency.  This group of households is commonly referred to as \"hand-to-mouth\"-- they consume most of their income not too long after they receive it (mostly within a quarter).  There are several reasons why a household could be hand-to-mouth, but one plausible explanation is that these households are *even more impatient* than estimated by Carroll et al for the most impatient agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will explore the micro- and macroeconomic implications of some households being *very impatient*. Specifically, you will address the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does the distribution of the MPC change (relative to cstwMPC's baseline) if some simulated households are extremely impatient?  Do we observe a significant portion of hand-to-mouth households?\n",
    "2. How does the distribution (and aggregate level) of wealth change if some households are extremely impatient?  Does this distribution of $\\beta$ still generate a wealth distribution like the one seen in U.S. data?"

    "## Calibrating a Basic Version of cstwMPC\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, let's reproduce a simplified version of the main results from cstwMPC.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In cstwMPC, the authors calibrated nearly all of the model parameters-- risk aversion, income shock process, etc-- to commonly used or previously estimated values.  The only parameter to be estimated is the distribution of $\\beta$.  Carroll et al assumed that $\\beta$ is uniformly distributed on $[\\grave{\\beta}-\\nabla,\\grave{\\beta}+\\nabla]$, approximated by a seven point distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In their estimation, the authors seek the values of $\\grave{\\beta}$ and $\\nabla$ that generate a simulated distribution of wealth that best matches empirical U.S. data.  Their definition of \"best match\" has two aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The simulated aggregate capital-to-income ratio matches the true U.S. value.\n",
    "2. The sum of squared distances between the simulated and empirical Lorenz curves (at the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th) percentiles is minimized (conditional on item 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "cstwMPC's target empirical moments are a capital-to-income ratio of 10.26 and cumulative wealth shares as given in the table below.  Yes, you are reading the table correctly: The \"poorest\" 80% of households own 17.5% of wealth. \n",
