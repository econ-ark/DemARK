It takes a function $f$, computes $\\beta\\mathbb{E}_{t}\\left[ \\frac{u^{\\prime}(d_{t+1})}{u^{\\prime}(d_t)} (f(d_{t+1}) + d_{t+1}) \\right]$ for a grid of $d_t$ values, and uses the result to construct a linear interpolator that approximates $T[f]$.\n",

Once changes between successive iterations are small enough, it declares that the solution has converged."
