    "This notebook provides a simple introduction to the \"DCEGM\" algorithm <cite data-cite=\"6202365/4F64GG8F\"></cite>. DCEGM extends the EGM method proposed in <cite data-cite=\"6202365/HQ6H9JEI\"></cite> to problems with both continuous (e.g. consumption) and discrete (e.g. retirement) decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge for the EGM algorithm in discrete-continuous problems is that the discrete decisions generate \"kinks\" in the value function, making it non-concave and rendering the first order condition used by EGM a necessary but not sufficient for optimality. In practice, this causes the EGM inversion step to produce (resource, consumption) points that are not optimal. DCEGM incorporates a method to filter the points produced by EGM so that only the truly optimal ones are used in producing an approximation to the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This filtering process consists mainly of computing \"upper-envelopes\" of the candidate points: lines that are made up only of the points with the higher values.\n",
