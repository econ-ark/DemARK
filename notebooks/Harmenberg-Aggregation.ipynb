    "# Now Compare the Variances of Simulated Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Harmenberg (2021) and Szeidl (2013) prove that with an infinite population size, models of this kind will have constant and identical growth rates of aggregate consumption, market resources, and noncapital income.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method of comparing the efficiency of the two methods is therefore to calculate the variance of the simulated aggregate variables, and see how many agents must be simulated using each of them in order to achieve a given variance.  (An infinite number of agents would be required to achieve zero variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots below show the (logs of) the estimated variances for the two methods as a function of the (logs of) the number of agents."

    "# Harmenberg's Method Produces Large Gains in Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of agents required to achieve a given variance is revealed by choosing that variance and then finding the points on the horizontal axis that correspond to the two methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upper variance plot shows that the efficiency gains are very large for consumption: The horizontal gap between the two loci is generally more than two orders of magnitude.  That is, Harmenberg's method requires less than **one-hundredth** as many agents as the standard method would require for a given precision.  Alternatively, for a given number of agents it is typically more than 10 times as precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The improvement in variance is smaller for market resources, likely because in a buffer stock model the point of consumers' actions is to use assets to absorb shocks.  But even for $\\MLvl$, the Harmenberg method attains any given level of precision ($\\text{var}\\left(\\{\\MLvlest_t\\}_{t\\in\\mathcal{T}}\\right)$) with roughly **one tenth** of the agents needed by the standard method to achieve that same level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, these results apply only to the particular configuration of parameter values that is the default in the HARK toolkit (but which were chosen long before Harmenberg developed his method).  The degree of improvement will vary depending on the calibration -- for example, if the magnitude of permanent shocks is small or zero, the method will yield little or no improvement."
