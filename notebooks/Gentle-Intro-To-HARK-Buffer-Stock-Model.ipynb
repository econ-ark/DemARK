    "## The Consumer's Problem with Transitory and Permanent Shocks\n",
    "### Mathematical Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Our new type of consumer receives two income shocks at the beginning of each period.  Permanent income would grow by a factor $\\Gamma$ in the absence of any shock , but its growth is modified by a shock, $\\psi_{t+1}$:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " P_{t+1} & = \\Gamma P_{t}\\psi_{t+1}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "whose expected (mean) value is $\\mathbb{E}_{t}[\\psi_{t+1}]=1$.  Actual income received $Y$ is equal to permanent income $P$ multiplied by a transitory shock $\\theta$:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " Y_{t+1} & = \\Gamma P_{t+1}\\theta_{t+1}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where again $\\mathbb{E}_{t}[\\theta_{t+1}] = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the perfect foresight problem, this model can be rewritten in terms of _normalized_ variables, e.g. the ratio of 'market resources' $M_{t}$ (wealth plus current income) to permanent income is $m_t \\equiv M_t/P_t$.  (See [here](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/BufferStockTheory/) for the theory).  In addition, lenders may set a limit on borrowing: The ratio $a_{t}$ of end-of-period assets to permanent income $A_t/P_t$ must be greater than $\\underline{a} \\leq 0$. (So, if $\\underline{a}=-0.3$, the consumer cannot borrow more than 30 percent of their permanent income).\n",
    "\n",
    "The consumer's (normalized) problem turns out to be:\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "v_t(m_t) &=& \\max_{c_t} ~~u(c_t) + \\beta  \\mathbb{E} [(\\Gamma_{t+1}\\psi_{t+1})^{1-\\rho} v_{t+1}(m_{t+1}) ], \\\\\n",

    "For present purposes, we assume that the transitory and permanent shocks are independent.  The permanent shock is assumed to be (approximately) lognormal, while the transitory shock has two components: A probability $\\wp$ that the consumer is unemployed, in which case $\\theta^{u}=\\underline{\\theta}$, and a probability $(1-\\wp)$ of a shock that is a lognormal with a mean chosen so that $\\mathbb{E}_{t}[\\theta_{t+n}]=1$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Computers are discrete devices; even if somehow we knew with certainty that the transitory and permanent shocks were, say, continuously lognormally distributed, in order to be represented on a computer those distributions would need to be approximated by a finite set of points.  A large literature in numerical computation explores ways to construct such approximations; probably the easiest discretization to understand is the equiprobable approximation, in which the continuous distribution is represented by a set of $N$ outcomes that are equally likely to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a single variable (say, the permanent shock $\\psi$), and when the number of equiprobable points is, say, 5, the procedure is to construct a list: $\\psi^{0}$ is the mean value of the continuous $\\psi$ given that the draw of $\\psi$ is in the bottom 20 percent of the distribution of the continuous $\\psi$.  $\\psi^{1}$ is the mean value of $\\psi$ given that the draw is between the 20th and 40th percentiles, and so on.  Having constructed these, the approximation to the expectation of some expression $g(\\psi)$ can be very quickly calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}_{t}[g(\\psi)] \\equiv \\int_{0}^{\\infty} g(\\psi) dF_{\\psi} \\approx (1/N) \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} g(\\psi^{i}).\n",
