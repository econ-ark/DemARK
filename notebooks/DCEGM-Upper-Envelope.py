#
# This notebook provides a simple introduction to the "DCEGM" algorithm <cite data-cite="6202365/4F64GG8F"></cite>. DCEGM extends the EGM method proposed in <cite data-cite="6202365/HQ6H9JEI"></cite> to problems with both continuous (e.g. consumption) and discrete (e.g. retirement) decisions.
#
# The main challenge for the EGM algorithm in discrete-continuous problems is that the discrete decisions generate "kinks" in the value function, making it non-concave and rendering the first order condition used by EGM a necessary but not sufficient for optimality. In practice, this causes the EGM inversion step to produce (resource, consumption) points that are not optimal. DCEGM incorporates a method to filter the points produced by EGM so that only the truly optimal ones are used in producing an approximation to the solution.
#
# This filtering process consists mainly of computing "upper-envelopes" of the candidate points: lines that are made up only of the points with the higher values.
#
# This notebook presents HARK's tool for calculating upper-envelopes and then uses it to solve a simple three-period discrete-continuous problem using DCEGM.

# Start by importing the tools.

# %% [markdown]
# Applying EGM to value functions with kinks, as the ones that result from discrete-continuous problems, will often result in grids for market resources that are not monotonic and candidate choices at those points that are sub-optimal.
# Consider the following example output.

# %%
m_egm = np.array([0.0, 0.04, 0.25, 0.15, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6,0.5, 0.35, 0.6, 0.75,0.85])

plt.plot(m_egm, vt_egm)
plt.xlabel("Resources")
plt.ylabel("Value")

# %% [markdown]
# There are two main issues:
# - The line implied by the points "goes backwards" at some points. This is because the m-grid is not monotonic.
# - Some segments of the line are under other segments of the line. This means that we have sub-optimal points.

# %% [markdown]
# A first step in filtering out sub-optimal points is to split the previous line in its non-decreasing segments. This is achieved by HARK's function `calcSegments`. 

# %%
# Compute non-decreasing segments
rise, fall = calcSegments(m_egm, vt_egm)

# Plot them
for j in range(len(fall)):
    idx = range(rise[j],fall[j]+1)
    plt.plot(m_egm[idx], vt_egm[idx])
plt.xlabel("resources")
plt.ylabel("transformed values")
plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# The next step is to produce the upper-envelope of these segments: a line comprised of the points that are not under any other segment. This is done by HARK's `calcMultilineEnvelope`function. We now apply it and plot the result

# %%
# The function defines the upper envelope over a new grid, which it
# uses to interpolate each of the non-decreasing segments.
m_common = np.linspace(0,1.0,100)

# # An example: writing a will
# ### Author: [Mateo VelÃ¡squez-Giraldo](https://mv77.github.io/)
#
# We now present a basic example to illustrate the use of the previous tools in solving dynamic optimization problems with discrete and continuous decisions.
#
# The model represents an agent that lives for three periods and decides how much of his resources to consume in each of them. On the second period, he must additionally decide whether to hire a lawyer to write a will. Having a will has the upside of allowing the agent to leave a bequest in his third and last period of life, which gives him utility, but has the downside that the lawyer will charge a fraction of his period 3 resources.
#
# On each period, the agent receives a deterministic amount of resources $w$. The problem, therefore, is fully deterministic.
#
# I now present the model formally, solving it backwards.
#
# But first, some setup and calibration:

# %%
# Import tools for linear interpolation and finding optimal
# discrete choices.
from HARK.interpolation import calcLogSumChoiceProbs

# Import CRRA utility (and related) functions from HARK 
from HARK.utilities import CRRAutility, CRRAutilityP, CRRAutilityP_inv

# Model parameters

# Parameters that need to be fixed
# Relative risk aversion. This is fixed at 2 in order to mantain
# the analytical solution that we use, from Carroll (2000)
CRRA   = 2 

# Parameters that can be changed.
w          = 1    # Deterministic wage per period.
willCstFac = 0.35 # Fraction of resources charged by lawyer for writing a will.
DiscFac    = 0.98 # Time-discount factor.

# Define utility (and related) functions
u     = lambda x: CRRAutility(x,CRRA)
uP    = lambda x: CRRAutilityP(x, CRRA)
uPinv = lambda x: CRRAutilityP_inv(x, CRRA)

# Create a grid for market resources
mGrid       = (aGrid-aGrid[0])*1.5
mGridPlots  = np.linspace(w,10*w,100)
mGridPlotsC = np.insert(mGridPlots,0,0)

# Transformations for value funtion interpolation
vTransf   = lambda x: np.exp(x)
vUntransf = lambda x: np.log(x)

# %% [markdown]
# # The third (last) period of life
#
# In the last period of life, the agent's problem is determined by his total amount of resources $m_3$ and a state variable $W$ that indicates whether he wrote a will ($W=1$) or not ($W=0$).
#
# ### The agent without a will
#
# An agent who does not have a will simply consumes all of his available resources. Therefore, his value and consumption functions will be:
#
# \begin{equation}
# V_3(m_3,W=0) = u(m_3)
# \end{equation}
#
# \begin{equation}
# c_3(m_3, W=0) = m_3
# \end{equation}
#
# Where $u(\cdot)$ gives the utility from consumption. We assume a CRRA specification $u(c) = \frac{c^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}$.
#
# ### The agent with a will
#
# An agent who wrote a will decides how to allocate his available resources $m_3$ between his consumption and a bequest. We assume an additive specification for the utility of a given consumption-bequest combination that follows a particular case in [Carroll (2000)](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/Why.pdf). The component of utility from leaving a bequest $x$ is assumed to be $\ln (x+1)$. Therefore, the agent's value function is
#
# \begin{equation}
# V_3(m_3, W=1) = \max_{0\leq c_3 \leq m_3} u(c_3) + \ln(m_3 - c_3 + 1)
# \end{equation}
#
# For ease of exposition we consider the case $\rho = 2$, where [Carroll (2000)](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/Why.pdf) shows that the optimal consumption level is given by
#
# \begin{equation}
# c_3(m_3, W=1) = \min \left[m_3, \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 4(m_3+1)}}{2} \right].
# \end{equation}
#
# The consumption function shows that $m_3=1$ is the level of resources at which an important change of behavior occurs: agents leave bequests only for $m_3 > 1$. Since an important change of behavior happens at this point, we call it a 'kink-point' and add it to our grids.

# # The second period
#
# On the second period, the agent takes his resources as given (the only state variable) and makes two decisions:
# - Whether to write a will or not.
# - What fraction of his resources to consume.
#
# These decisions can be seen as happening sequentially: the agent first decides whether to write a will or not, and then consumes optimally in accordance with his previous decision. Since we solve the model backwards in time, we first explore the consumption decision, conditional on the choice of writing a will or not.
#
# ## An agent who decides not to write a will
#
# After deciding not to write a will, an agent solves the optimization problem expressed in the following conditional value function
#
# \begin{equation}
# \begin{split}
# \nu (m_2|w=0) &= \max_{0\leq c \leq m_2} u(c) + \beta V_3(m_3,W=0)\\
# s.t.&\\
# m_3 &= m_2 - c + w
# \end{split} 
# \end{equation}
#
# We can approximate a solution to this problem through the method of endogenous gridpoints. This yields approximations to $\nu(\cdot|w=0)$ and $c_2(\cdot|w=0)$

# Get consumption through EGM inversion of the euler equation
cGrid2_cond_no = uPinv(DiscFac*vPGrid3_no)

# Get beginning-of-period market resources
mGrid2_cond_no = aGrid + cGrid2_cond_no

# Compute value function
vGrid2_cond_no = u(cGrid2_cond_no) + DiscFac*v3_no(mGrid3_cond_nowi)

# Create interpolating value and consumption functions
vT2_cond_no = LinearInterp(mGrid2_cond_no, vTransf(vGrid2_cond_no), lower_extrap = True)
v2_cond_no  = lambda x: vUntransf(vT2_cond_no(x))

# %% [markdown]
# ## An agent who decides to write a will
#
# An agent who decides to write a will also solves for his consumption dinamically. We assume that the lawyer that helps the agent write his will takes some fraction $\tau$ of his total resources in period 3. Therefore, the evolution of resources is given by $m_3 = (1-\tau)(m_2 - c_2 + w)$. The conditional value function of the agent is therefore:
#
# \begin{equation}
# \begin{split}
# \nu (m_2|w=1) &= \max_{0\leq c \leq m_2} u(c) + \beta V_3(m_3,W=1)\\
# s.t.&\\
# m_3 &= (1-\tau)(m_2 - c + w)
# \end{split} 
# \end{equation}
#
# We also approximate a solution to this problem using the EGM. This yields approximations to $\nu(\cdot|w=1)$ and $c_2(\cdot|w=1)$.

# Get consumption through EGM inversion of the euler equation

# # The first period
#
# In the first period, the agent simply observes his market resources and decides what fraction of them to consume. His problem is represented by the following value function
#
# \begin{equation}
# \begin{split}
# V (m_1) &= \max_{0\leq c \leq m_1} u(c) + \beta V_2(m_2)\\
# s.t.&\\
# m_2 &= m_1 - c + w.
# \end{split} 
# \end{equation}
#
# Although this looks like a simple problem, there are complications introduced by the kink in $V_2(\cdot)$, which is clearly visible in the plot from the previous block. Particularly, note that $V_2'(\cdot)$ and $c_2(\cdot)$ are not monotonic: there are now multiple points $m$ for which the slope of $V_2(m)$ is equal. Thus, the Euler equation becomes a necessary but not sufficient condition for optimality and the traditional EGM inversion step can generate non-monotonic endogenous $m$ gridpoints.
