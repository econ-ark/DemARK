    "Please write the names and email addresses of everyone who worked on this notebook on the line below.\n",

    "YOUR NAMES HERE\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook \"Micro-and-Macro-Implications-of-Very-Impatient-HHs\" is an exercise that demonstrates the consequences of changing a key parameter of the [cstwMPC](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC) model, the time preference factor $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [REMARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK) `SolvingMicroDSOPs` reproduces the last figure in the [SolvingMicroDSOPs](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/SolvingMicroDSOPs) lecture notes, which shows that there are classes of alternate values of $\\beta$ and $\\rho$ that fit the data almost as well as the exact 'best fit' combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by this comparison, this notebook asks you to examine the consequences for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The consumption function\n",
    "* The distribution of wealth\n",
    "\n",
    "Of _joint_ changes in $\\beta$ and $\\rho$ together.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One way you can do this is to construct a list of alternative values of $\\rho$ (say, values that range upward from the default value of $\\rho$, in increments of 0.2, all the way to $\\rho=5$).  Then for each of these values of $\\rho$ you will find the value of $\\beta$ that leads the same value for target market resources, $\\check{m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, $\\check{m}$ is defined as the value of $m$ at which the optimal value of ${c}$ is the value such that, at that value of ${c}$, the expected level of ${m}$ next period is the same as its current value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbb{E}_{t}[{m}_{t+1}] = {m}_{t}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Other notes:\n",
    "* The cstwMPC model solves and simulates the problems of consumers with 7 different values of $\\beta$\n",
    "   * You should do your exercise using the middle value of $\\beta$ from that exercise: \n",
    "      * `DiscFac_mean   = 0.9855583`\n",
    "* You are likely to run into the problem, as you experiment with parameter values, that you have asked HARK to solve a model that does not satisfy one of the impatience conditions required for the model to have a solution.  Those conditions are explained intuitively in the [TractableBufferStock](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/public/lecturenotes/consumption/TractableBufferStock/) model.  The versions of the impatience conditions that apply to the $\\texttt{IndShockConsumerType}$ model can be found in the paper [BufferStockTheory](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/BufferStockTheory), table 2.\n",
    "   * The conditions that need to be satisfied are:\n",
    "      * The Growth Impatience Condition (GIC)\n",
    "      * The Return Impatience Condition (RIC)\n",
    "* Please accumulate the list of solved consumers' problems in a list called `MyTypes`\n",
    "   * For compatibility with a further part of the assignment below"
