# # Lucas Asset Pricing Model
#
# ## A notebook by [Christopher D. Carroll](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/) and [Mateo VelÃ¡squez-Giraldo](https://mv77.github.io/)
# ### Inspired by its [Quantecon counterpart](https://julia.quantecon.org/multi_agent_models/lucas_model.html)
#
# This notebook presents simple computational tools to solve Lucas' asset-pricing model when the logarithm of the asset's dividend follows an autoregressive process of order 1,
#
# \begin{equation*}
# \ln d_{t+1} = \alpha \ln d_t + \varepsilon_{t+1}.
# \end{equation*}
#
# A presentation of this model can be found in [Christopher D. Carroll's lecture notes](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/public/lecturenotes/AssetPricing/LucasAssetPrice/). 
#
# Those notes [derive](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/public/lecturenotes/AssetPricing/LucasAssetPrice/#pofc) from the Bellman equation a relationship between the price of the asset in the current period $t$ and the next period $t+1$:  
#
# \begin{equation*}
# P_{t} = 
# \overbrace{\left(\frac{1}{1+\vartheta}\right)}
# ^{\beta}\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[ \frac{u^{\prime}(d_{t+1})}{u^{\prime}(d_t)} (P_{t+1} + d_{t+1}) \right]
# \end{equation*}
#
# The equilibrium pricing equation is a relationship between prices and dividend (a "pricing kernel") $P^{*}(d)$ such that, if everyone _believes_ that to be the pricing kernel, everyone's Euler equation will be satisfied:
#
# \begin{equation*}
# P^*(d_t) = \left(\frac{1}{1+\vartheta}\right)\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[ \frac{u^{\prime}(d_{t+1})}{u^{\prime}(d_t)} (P^*(d_{t+1}) + d_{t+1}) \right]
# \end{equation*}
#
# As noted in the handout, there are some special circumstances in which it is possible to solve for $P^{*}$ analytically:
#
# | Shock Process | CRRA | Solution for Pricing Kernel | 
# | --- | --- | --- |
# | bounded | 1 (log) | $P^*(d) = \frac{d}{\vartheta}$ |
# | lognormal, mean 1 | $\rho$ | $P^*(d) = d_t^\rho\ e^{\rho(\rho-1)\sigma^2/2}\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}$ |
#
# However, under less special circumstances, the only way to obtain the pricing function $P^{*}$ is by solving for it numerically, as outlined below.

# %% [markdown]
# # Finding the equilibrium pricing function.
#
# We know that the equilibrium pricing function must satisfy the equation above. Let's define an operator that allows us to evaluate whether any candidate pricing function satisfies this requirement.
#
# Let $T$ be an operator which takes as argument a function and returns another function (these are usually called [functionals or higher-order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_(mathematics))). For some function $f$, denote with $T[f]$ the function that results from applying $T$ to $f$. Then, for any real number $x$, $T[f](x)$ will be the real number that one obtains when the function $T[f]$ is given $x$ as an input.
#
# We define our particular operator as follows. For any function $g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, $T[g]$ is obtained as
#
# \begin{equation*}
# \forall d_t \in \mathbb{R},\,\,\,\, T[g](d_t) := \beta\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[ \frac{u^{\prime}(d_{t+1})}{u^{\prime}(d_t)} (f(d_{t+1}) + d_{t+1}) \right].
# \end{equation*}
#
#
# We can use $T$ to re-express our pricing equation. If $P^*(\cdot)$ is our equilibrium pricing funtion, it must satisfy
#
# \begin{equation*}
# \forall d_t,\,\,\,\,P^*(d_t) = \beta\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[ \frac{u^{\prime}(d_{t+1})}{u^{\prime}(d_t)} (P^*(d_{t+1}) + d_{t+1}) \right] = T[P^*](d_t).
# \end{equation*}
# or, expressed differently,
# \begin{equation*}
# P^* = T[P^*].
# \end{equation*}
#
# Our equilibrium pricing function is therefore a *fixed point* of the operator $T$.
#
# It turns out that $T$ is a [contraction mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_mapping). This is useful because it implies, through [Banach's fixed-point theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_mapping), that:
# - $T$ has **exactly one** fixed point.
# - Starting from an arbitrary function $f$, the sequence $\{T^n[f]\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to such fixed point.
#
# For our purposes, this translates to:
# - Our equilibrium pricing function not only exists, but it is unique.
# - We can get arbitrarily close to the equilibrium pricing function by making some initial guess $f$ and applying the operator $T$ to it repeatedly. 
#
# The code below creates a representation of our model and implements a solution routine to find $P^*$. The main components of this routine are:
#
# - `priceOnePeriod`: this is operator $T$ from above. It takes a function $f$, computes $\beta\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[ \frac{u^{\prime}(d_{t+1})}{u^{\prime}(d_t)} (f(d_{t+1}) + d_{t+1}) \right]$ for a grid of $d_t$ values, and uses the result to construct a linear interpolator that approximates $T[f]$.
#
# - `solve`: this is our iterative solution procedure. It generates an initial guess $f$ and applies `priceOnePeriod` to it iteratively. At each application, it constructs a measure of how much the candidate pricing function changed. Once changes between successive iterations are small enough, it declares that the solution has converged.

# # Creating and solving an example economy
#
# An economy is fully specified by:
# - **The dividend process for the assets (trees)**: we assume that $\ln d_{t+1} = \alpha \ln d_t + \varepsilon_{t+1}$. We must create a dividend process specifying $\alpha$ and $\sigma_{\varepsilon}$.
# - **The coefficient of relative risk aversion (CRRA).**
# - **The time-discount factor ($\beta$).**

# %% Example {"code_folding": [0]}
# Create a log-AR1 process for dividends
DivProc = DivProcess(alpha = 0.90, shock_sd = 0.1)

# Create an example economy
economy = LucasEconomy(CRRA = 2, DiscFac = 0.95, DivProcess = DivProc)


# %% [markdown]
# Once created, the economy can be 'solved', which means finding the equilibrium price kernel. The distribution of dividends at period $t+1$ depends on the value of dividends at $t$, which also determines the resources agents have available to buy trees. Thus, $d_t$ is a state variable for the economy. The pricing function gives the price of trees that equates their demand and supply at every level of current dividends $d_t$.

# %% Solution {"code_folding": [0]}
# Solve the economy
economy.solve(disp = True)

# After the economy is solved, we can use its Equilibrium price function

# ## The effect of risk aversion.
#
# [The notes](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/public/lecturenotes/AssetPricing/LucasAssetPrice/) discuss the surprising implication that an increase in the coefficient of relative risk aversion $\rho$ leads to higher prices for the risky trees! This is demonstrated below.

#
# Hidden in the solution method implemented above is the fact that, in order to make expectations easy to compute, we discretize the random shock $\varepsilon_t$, which is to say, we create a discrete variable $\tilde{\varepsilon}$ that approximates the behavior of $\varepsilon_t$. This is done using a [Gauss-Hermite quadrature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Hermite_quadrature).
#
# A parameter for the numerical solution is the number of different values that we allow our discrete approximation $\tilde{\varepsilon}$ to take, $n^{\#}$. We would expect a higher $n^#$ to improve our solution, as the discrete approximation of $\varepsilon_t$ improves. We test this below.
