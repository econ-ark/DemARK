# # Micro- and Macroeconomic Implications of Very Impatient Households

# ## Introduction
#
# Buffer stock saving models of the kind implemented in $\texttt{ConsIndShockType}$ say that, if a standard ['Growth Impatience Condition'](https://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/BufferStockTheory/#Growth-Modified-Conditions), holds:
#
# \begin{eqnarray}
# \newcommand{\Rfree}{\mathsf{R}}\newcommand{\DiscFac}{\beta}\newcommand{\PermGroFac}{\Gamma}\newcommand{\PermShk}{\psi}\newcommand{\CRRA}{\rho}
# \left(\frac{(\Rfree\DiscFac)^{1/\CRRA}\mathbb{E}[\PermShk^{-1}]}{\PermGroFac}\right) & < & 1
# \end{eqnarray}
#
# then the _ratio_ of asets $\newcommand{\aLev}{\mathbf{a}}\aLev$ to permanent income $\newcommand{\pLev}{\mathbf{p}}\pLev$, $a=\aLev/\pLev$, has a target value $\newcommand{\aTarg}{\check{a}}\aTarg$ that depends on the consumer's preferences (relative risk aversion $\CRRA$, time preference $\DiscFac$) and circumstances (interest factor $\Rfree$, growth factor $\PermGroFac$, uncertainty about permanent income shocks $\sigma^{2}_{\PermShk}$).
#
# If everyone had identical preferences and everyone were at their target $\check{a}$, then inequality in the level of $\aLev$ would be exactly the same as inequality in $\pLev$.
#
# ["The Distribution of Wealth and the Marginal Propensity to Consume"](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC) (Carroll, Slacalek, Tokuoka, and White 2017; hereafter: "cstwMPC") shows that, when such a model is simulated and agents draw their idiosyncratic shocks (so, agents are _ex post_ heterogeneous -- see the definition in [Intro-To-HARK](http://github.com/econ-ark/PARK/tree/master/Intro-To-HARK.pdf)) -- asset inequality is indeed close to $\pLev$ inequality even though everyone is not always at exactly their target $a$.
#
# But a large body of evidence shows that _actual_ inequality in assets is much greater than _actual_ inequality in permanent income.  Thus, to make a model that qualifies as what cstwMPC call a 'serious' microfounded macro model of consumption (one that matches the key facts _theory says_ should be first-order important), the model must be modified to incorporate some form of _ex ante_ heterogeneity: That is, there must be differences across people in $\DiscFac$ or $\Rfree$ or $\CRRA$ or $\PermGroFac$ or $\sigma^{2}_{\PermShk}$.
#
# The most transparent and simplest of these to change is the time preference factor $\beta$.  So that is what the paper does.  The main results are:
#
# 1. The distribution of $\beta$ need not be particularly wide to match the extreme concentration of wealth: roughly 0.91 to 0.98 (annual); that is, the most impatient person discounts the future about 6 percentage points more per year than the most patient agent agent
# 2. With such a distribution of $\beta$, simulated agents' (annual) marginal propensity to consume (MPC) from transitory income shocks to income matches large body of microeconomic evidence that typically finds evidence of MPC's in the range of 0.2 to 0.6.  This is much better than RA macro models that typically yield MPC's in the range of 0.01 to 0.05.
#
# While the most impatient agents in the cstwMPC model have fairly high MPCs (~0.6 annual), there is microeconomic evidence that a significant fraction of households have *even higher* MPCs than the model predicts, especially at the quarterly frequency.  This group of households is commonly referred to as "hand-to-mouth" -- they consume most of their transitory shocks to income not too long after they receive them (mostly within a quarter).  There are several reasons why a household could be hand-to-mouth, but one plausible explanation is that these households are *even more impatient* than estimated by cstwMPC for the most impatient agent.

# ## Calibrating a Basic Version of cstwMPC
#
# To get started, let's reproduce a simplified version of the main results from cstwMPC.  
#
# In cstwMPC, the authors calibrated nearly all of the model parameters-- risk aversion, income shock process, etc-- to commonly used or previously estimated values.  The only parameter to be estimated is the distribution of $\beta$.  cstwMPC assumed that $\beta$ is uniformly distributed on $[\grave{\beta}-\nabla,\grave{\beta}+\nabla]$, approximated by a seven point distribution.
#
# Their estimation procedure seeks the values of $\grave{\beta}$ and $\nabla$ that generate a simulated distribution of wealth that best matches empirical U.S. data.  Their definition of "best match" has two aspects:
#
# 1. The simulated aggregate capital-to-income ratio matches the true U.S. value.
# 2. The sum of squared distances between the simulated and empirical Lorenz curves (at the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles) is minimized (conditional on item 1).
#
# cstwMPC's target empirical moments are a capital-to-income ratio of 10.26 and cumulative wealth shares as given in the table below.  Yes, you are reading the table correctly: The "poorest" 80 percent of households own 17.5 percent of wealth. 
#
# | Net worth percentile | Cumulative wealth share |
# |:---:|:---:|
# |  20th  | -0.2% |
# |  40th  | 1.0% |
# |  60th  | 5.5% |
# |  80th  | 17.5% |
#
# To reproduce their basic results, we must import an $\texttt{AgentType}$ subclass and define a dictionary with calibrated parameters identical to those in the paper.

# Now let's make several instances of our class of agents and give them different values of $\beta$, following cstwMPC's estimated distribution.  In our specification of interest, we will use $\grave{\beta}=0.9855583$ and $\nabla = 0.0085$.
#
# NB: Reported parameter estimates in cstwMPC use a model with aggregate shocks and wage and interest rates determined dynamically (a heterogeneous agents DSGE model); this is the $\texttt{AggShockConsumerType}$ in HARK.  The estimated parameters are slightly different in this exercise, as we are ignoring general equilibrium aspects and only using the $\texttt{IndShockConsumerType}$

# ## Solving and Simulating the Baseline Agents
#
# Now let's solve and simulate each of our types of agents.  If you look in the parameter dictionary (or at any of the agent objects themselves), you will see that each one has an $\texttt{AgentCount}$ attribute of 10000. That is, these seven ex ante heterogeneous types each represent ten thousand individual agents that will experience ex post heterogeneity when they draw different income (and mortality) shocks over time.
#
# In the code block below, fill in the contents of the loop to solve and simulate each agent type for many periods.  To do this, you should invoke the methods $\texttt{solve}$, $\texttt{initializeSim}$, and $\texttt{simulate}$ in that order.  Simulating for 1200 quarters (300 years) will approximate the long run distribution of wealth in the population.

# To verify that you wrote that code correctly, let's check that the aggregate level of capital (total assets held by all households) to income ratio equals what we expected it would be.  To do that, let's combine the asset holdings of all types, take the mean, and see if we get the desired capital to income ratio of 10.26.

# ## Adding Very Impatient Households
#
# Now that we have some tools for examining both microeconomic (the MPC across the population) and macroeconomic (the distribution and overall level of wealth) outcomes from our model, we are all set to conduct our experiment.
#
# In this exercise, we are going to add very impatient households to the economy in a very direct way: by replacing the *most impatient consumer type* with an *even more impatient type*.  Specifically, we will have these agents have a discount factor of $\beta = 0.80$ at a quarterly frequency, which corresponds to $\beta \approx 0.41$ annual.
#
# In the code block below, we:
#
# 1. Replicate the list of agents using $\texttt{deepcopy}$.
# 2. Set the $\beta$ of the most impatient type to $0.80$ (for the copied set of agents).
# 3. Solve and simulate the most impatient type (for the copied set of agents).
