# Repaired Scripts After Breaking Change

This branch demonstrates the complete solution to the HARK breaking change issue that was masked by CI environment caching.

## Background

- **May 22, 2024**: HARK commit `7a6e8f39` moved `HARK.datasets` to `HARK.Calibration`
- **September 18, 2024**: DemARK commit `ffc6131` appeared successful in CI but had old imports
- **Problem**: Environment caching masked the breaking change for 4 months

## What This Branch Contains

### Fixed Notebooks
- `notebooks/LC-Model-Expected-Vs-Realized-Income-Growth.ipynb` - Updated with correct imports
- All other notebooks work without changes

### Environment Setup
- `binder/environment.yml` - Configured with HARK commit `7a6e8f39` (the breaking change)
- `.envrc` - Automatic environment activation with direnv

### Demonstration Scripts
- `test_problematic_notebooks.sh` - Tests the two affected notebooks
- `fix_problematic_notebooks.sh` - Applies and verifies the fixes

## Usage

1. **Setup environment** (first time only):
   ```bash
   mamba env create -f binder/environment.yml
   direnv allow  # If you have direnv installed
   ```

2. **Test the original problem**:
   ```bash
   # First revert to old imports to see the problem
   git show HEAD~1:notebooks/LC-Model-Expected-Vs-Realized-Income-Growth.ipynb > notebooks/LC-Model-Expected-Vs-Realized-Income-Growth.ipynb
   ./test_problematic_notebooks.sh
   ```

3. **Apply and verify the fix**:
   ```bash
   ./fix_problematic_notebooks.sh
   ```

## The Fix

The breaking change moved HARK modules:
```python
# BEFORE (broken):
from HARK.datasets.life_tables.us_ssa.SSATools import parse_ssa_life_table

# AFTER (fixed):
from HARK.Calibration.life_tables.us_ssa.SSATools import parse_ssa_life_table
```

## Environment Details

- **HARK Version**: 0.14.1 (commit `7a6e8f39` - the breaking change)
- **Python**: 3.10
- **Environment Name**: `DemARK_problematic_combo`

This environment demonstrates what CI should have been testing if not for caching.
